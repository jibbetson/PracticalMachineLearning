This is a sample HTML document, including some of the default Rmd content to illustrate display of the page on a 'gh-pages' website on github.io until I post actual content related to the Coursera JHU Practical Machine Learning course project in July 2017. Note that all content is public.


```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
